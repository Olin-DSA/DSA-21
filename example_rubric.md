For each problem, you can earn points for:
* **Understanding**: demonstrating understanding of the solution to the problem. (Note: this does not mean that you have to get it on your first try; being able to articulate why the correct solution is the correct solution is also sufficient and modify your solution appropriately is also sufficient).
* **Process**: demonstrating a solid process for arriving at the solution, which can be demonstrated by either comments within your code illustrating your thought process if you had the correct solution, or detailed and thoughtful self-reflection on the flaws in your process if you did not have the right solution.
